    "The fields in the CSV can be obtained or derived from the FITS header files of the captured images. However, the filter value requires translation from the filter name (e.g., Ha or OIII) as reported in the FITS header to the numeric ID used by AstroBin. To facilitate this translation, a `filter.csv` file is created to define the mapping between filter names and AstroBin filter codes. Below is an example showing a `filter.csv` file that describes a typical filter set:\n",

For example, consider a Ha filter: a 2-inch H-alpha CCD 6nm filter from Astronomik. By using AstroBin's equipment explorer to navigate to this filter's page, the URL might look something like:\n",

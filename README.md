# README.md for AstroBinUploader.py

## Features

This Python script is designed to create an acqusition.csv file suitable for upload to AstroBin's import CSV dialogue.  
The acqusition.csv file is obtained by extracting the FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) headers of all the image files associated with a given astronomical target.
FITS image files must be generated by the image capture package [N.I.N.A](https://nighttime-imaging.eu/) 

 Key features include:

- **Extraction of FITS Headers**: Extracts headers for all FITS files in specified directories.
- **Calibration Data Summarization**: Summarizes calibration sessions by processing FLAT, BIAS, DARK and FLATDARK frames.
- **LIGHT Data Processing**: Aggregates LIGHT frames for the identified target.
- **Sky Quality Analysis**: Calculates SQM and Bortle scale classification based on the observation location coordinates.
- **Auxiliary Parameter Calculation**: Calculates additional parameters like Image Scale (IMSCALE), and Full-width Half Maximum (FWHM) from measured/estimated HFR values for each image.
- **AstroBin Compatibility**: Formats aggregated data for upload to AstroBin's import CSV file dialogue.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x, see this for instructions how to install Python 
- Pandas library
- Astropy library
- Requests library

Instructions can be how to install Python can be found here [Python Installation Instructions](https://python.land/installing-python).   
With Python installed the required libraries can be installed from the command line by typing: 

`pip install pandas astropy requests`

## Installation of Python script

To install this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SteveGreaves/AstroBinUploader).
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed. If not, use `pip install pandas astropy requests`.
3. Place the script in a directory, you can call this what you want.

## External Files

The script requires the following external CSV files for its operation:

- **filter.csv**: Contains mappings of filter names to their codes.
- **sites.csv**: Stores latitude, longitude, Bortle scale, and SQM values for known locations.
- **secret.csv**: Holds API keys and endpoints for external services (e.g., light pollution data).

Ensure these files are present in the same directory as the script.

### Run the script from the installation directory as follows 

        `python3 AstroBinUploadCSV.py directory_path1 directory_path2  directory_pathn hfr_set`.

There can be as many directory paths as required to capture all the image files, but the minimum is one. The image files can be collected in one or more directories.  
The last argument passed to the function is hfr_set. This represents the hfr value in pixels the user wishes to use for all the images. hfr_set will be used by the code if there is no value for HFR found in the image pathname.
If hfr_set is empty or not a floating point number FWHM will be equal to zero, if it is a floating point number FWHM will be calculated using this value.  

An example program call where HFR is not in the pathname and is passed as an argument when calling the function is given below:

        'python3 AstroBinUploadCSV.py "/mnt/HDD_8TB/Preselected/Rosette Nebula (Caldwell 49)" "/mnt/HDD_8TB/Preselected/Calibration data/30th April 2023" "/mnt/HDD_8TB/Preselected/Calibration data/20th April 2023/DARK" 1.6'


This generates the following command line output:

## Additional Information

# Night Time Imaging N Astronomy ([N.I.N.A](https://nighttime-imaging.eu/) )

This code has been developed for use with FITS files generated by the astroimaging package [N.I.N.A](https://nighttime-imaging.eu/) At the moment it will not work with images produced by other capture packages, such as SGP.  

A FITS header file generated by N.I.N.A is quite rich in information, an example is given below:

The fields in the CSV are obtained or derived from the FITS header files of the captured images. However, the filter value requires translation from the filter name to an AstroBin filter code

## filter.csv file

The 'filter.csv' file defines the mapping from the filter name to AstroBin's filter code. Below is an filters.csv content showing the names my Astronomik 2 inch filters, as generated by N.I.N.A, and their corresponding AstroBin codes:

| **Filter** | **Code** |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Ha | 4663 |
| SII | 4844 |
| OIII | 4752 |
| Red | 4649 |
| Green | 4643 |
| Blue | 4637 |
| Lum | 2906 |
| CLS | 4061 |

You can edit this file to enable your filters used. The filter names should match the names N.I.N.A generates for your filters.

### Finding the AstroBin Numeric ID for Filters

The numeric ID of a filter can be found by examining the URL of the filter's page in the [AstroBin equipment database](https://app.astrobin.com/equipment/explorer/filter?page=1).   

For example, consider a [2-inch H-alpha CCD 6nm filter from Astronomik](https://app.astrobin.com/equipment/explorer/filter/4663/astronomik-h-alpha-ccd-6nm-2). By using [AstroBin's filter explorer](https://app.astrobin.com/equipment/explorer/filter?page=1) to navigate to this filter's page the URL is found to be :

https://app.astrobin.com/equipment/explorer/filter/4663/astronomik-h-alpha-ccd-6nm-2

From this URL, the AstroBin code for this Astronomik 2-inch H-alpha CCD 6nm filter is 4663.

### Creating the filters.csv File

The `filters.csv` file can be created using a text editor and should be located in the directory from which the Python script is executed. The script relies on this file to ensure the correct codes are used for your filters.

## sites.csv file

The sites.csv file contains the Bortle and SQM values for a given latitude and longitude. An example of a sites.csv file with one entry is given below.

|
|**Latitude** | **Longitude**| **Bortle** | **SQM** |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------- |
| 52.248 | -0.123 | 4 | 20.52|

The program reads the sites.csv data into a dataframe. As the code loops through the data it obtains the site location's latitude and longitude from the FITS header for the image under consideration. If the location matches a location in the sites dataframe it uses the values of Bortle and SQM for those coordinates.
If there is no match it obtains the values of Bortle and SQM from an external website. The code will then add the new site information to the sites.csv file. Site data also can be entered manually into the sites.csv. If no matching site data is found in the sites.csv and the external site cannot be accessed the Bortle and SQM values are set equal to zero.

## secret.csv and accessing sky quality data

The artificial_brightness of the sky at a given latitude and longitude is obtained from the excellent web resource https://www.lightpollutionmap.info. This can be by done by visiting the website and entering the latitude and longitude of the observation site and obtaining the parameters Bortle and SQM. These parameters can then be entered into the sites.csv file. It can also be done programmatically by the code. To do this you need to place an API_KEY and API_ENDPOINT for the service in the secret.csv file. The only API_ENDPOINT supported currently is https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/QueryRaster/. You will have to apply to Jurij Stare, the website owner, for an API key. Jurij's email address is starej@t-2.net. The approach I suggest is: donate a small amount to the upkeep of his excellent website. You will then receive a thank-you e-mail, in response ask Jurij for an API key.

secret.csv format
| **API Key** | **API Endpoint**|
| ----------- | --------------- | 
| **************** | https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/QueryRaster/ |

## FWHM values

The AstroBin Long Exposure Acquisition Fields has an entry for meanFwhm. This is not directly available from the FITS header file. But N.I.N.A allows for the mean HFR value of an image to be embedded in the image file name. An example of my file naming convention, with HFR embedded, is given below: 

NGC 7822_Panel_1_Date_2023-09-02_Time_21-09-01_Filter_Ha_Exposure_600.00s_HFR_1.64px_FrameNo_0002.fits

The code will look for the key word HFR in the image file name. If found it will extract the HFR value and assign it to a variable hfr. As HFR is in pixels it calculates the image scale from the telescope information held in the FITS header. In particular XPIXSZ: x pixel size in microns and FOCALLEN: telescope focal length in mm

imscale = XPIXSZ / FOCALLEN * 206.265
fwhm = hfr * imscale

The calculations above assume that all stars are circular and so hfr and fwhm are equivalent, it is a reasonable approximation as the code averages hfr across all images taken on a particular date with a given filter and gain and then AstroBin averages hfr across all entries in the uploaded CSV file.
